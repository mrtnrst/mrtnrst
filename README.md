<details>
  Professionally, I’ve been programming for the past 7 years, working towards 8 (I've been doing some version of this since 08 which feels like so long ago now.). I focus on UI engineering, utilizing JavaScript, TypeScript, Swift, React Native,  and Objective-C. I've built various things in Java, Kotlin, and Python as well. I’m self-motivated and passionate about my craft. I'm always learning new things, teaching others what I learn, and never shying away from anything that comes my way.
